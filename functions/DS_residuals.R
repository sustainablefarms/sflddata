# Dunn-Smyth Residuals for Detection and Occupancy
# Ref: Warton Mackenzie et al, Rprsence DS residuals and Boral's Dunn-Smyth Residuals

# Inputs: object of class runjags
# Subinputs: Predictions is a dataframe with each *row* a visit and a species with the site visited given by column SiteID,
#            species given by column Species
#            and detection probabilities by pDetected.
#            Observations are a dataframe with rows the same as predictions data frame.
#            SiteID gives the site, Species indicates the species
#            'Detected' is TRUE if species detected

# Components

# given a vector (list?) of x, cdf is the CDF evaluated at x, and cdfminus is the CDF evaluated at the value just below x
cdfvals_2_dsres_discrete <- function(cdf, cdfminus, seed = NULL){
  set.seed(seed)
  u<-runif(length(cdf));  # Standard uniform value to "jitter" the cdf.
  residDet<-qnorm(cdf*u + cdfminus*(1-u));      # Dunn-Smyth residual, standard normal if cdf correct.
  return(residDet)
}

## Define a function to get the detection pdf under unequal detections, for a given site and species
## (regardless of whether species is in occupation, or if it is ever detected)
## Based heavily on Rpresence code, WARNING: do not know what the license for Rpresense source code is!! Can't use code directly at least.
