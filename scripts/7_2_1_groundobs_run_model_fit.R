### Guide to inputs names and dimensions
#n.env.var  number of random environmental variables for occupancy
#J = n.sites    number of 'sites' to fit occupancy and detection (is separated by year/season)
#               (j is often used for the site index)
#y          Matrix, 1 row per visit. Detection of species at a visit. The site of each visit given by ModelSite. Values are either 0 or 1.
#ModelSite   is a list of the (model) site observed for each visit. Note these are locations in space and TIME. (i.e same spatial location at different years is a different model site)
#n.species  number of species     
#nlv        number of latent variables
#n          number of species
#Xocc       matrix of covariates to predict occupancy (include a column of 1s for intercept). 1 row per site.
#           (Ordered according to site index: must be compatible with ObservedSite.)
#Xobs       matrix of covariates to predict detection (include a column of 1s for intercept). 1 row per visit.
#Vvisits    number of visits in total

### within the model specification:
# mu.u.b is a list of the prior distributions for the *mean* of occupancy covariate effects (one for each covariate)
# tau.u.b is a list of the prior distributions for the standard deviation of the occupany covariate effects
# sigma.u.b is a used to define tau.u.b
# u.b is an array of distributions. Each row corresponds to a species, each column to an occupancy covariate. Distributional params given by mu.u.b and tau.u.b.
#** I didn't think this is how occupany effects would work, why are occupancy effects 'random effects' that have this two level distributions?
## In Tobler's paper 'species-level' effects are treated as random effects. To improve estimates of rare species and convergence.
## u.b combined with occupancy covariates and latent variables to give the mean of the occupancy random variable.


# mu.v.b is a list of the prior distributions for the *mean* of detection covariate effects (one for each covariate)
# tau.v.b is a list of the prior distributions for the *standard deviation* of the detection covariate effects
# sigma.v.b is a used to define tau.v.b
# v.b is an array of distributions. Each row corresponds to a species, each column to a detection covariate. Distributional params given by mu.v.b and tau.v.b.

# LV is a matrix of prior distributions for the value of latent variables. Each row corresponds to a site. Each column corresponds to a latent variable.
# lv.coef is a matrix of prior distributions of the coefficients for the LV values (restrictions really). 
## Each row corresponds to a species. Each column is a latent variable.
## Constraints are present for identifiability.
