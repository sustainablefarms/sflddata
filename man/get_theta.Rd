\title{A helper function to get a vector of parameters from a fitted object}
\usage{
get_theta(fit, type)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{fitted runjags object with summary included}

\item{type}{An integer will select the draw from the posterior
(e.g. type = 5 will return the vector of parameters in the 5th sample from the posterior, mcmc chains are concatenated)
A charactor vector can be used to the parameters based on summarary statistics like quantiles and moments.
Supported values so far "median" and "mean".}
