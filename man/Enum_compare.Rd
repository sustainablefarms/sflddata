\title{Compare Expected Number of Species at ModelSites}
\usage{
Enum_compare(observed, predicted, predictedV)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A list of the number of species observed for each ModelSite}

\item{predicted}{A dataframe or matrix with each column the expected number of species detected from a single model. Each row is a ModelSite in the same order as \link{observed}.}

\item{predictedV}{Same as \link{predicted}, but the variance of the number of species detected.}
}
\value{
A matrix with a column for the aggregate (summed) difference of model sites between models,
and the standard error of this difference (computed as the sample standard deviation of difference, multiplied by the square root of the number of ModelSites)
}
\description{
Compare Expected Number of Species at ModelSites
}
\details{
Very similar to elpd_compare().
Assume each ModelSite with detection parameters are iid samples from a common distribution.
In this regime the expected number of species for a ModelSite and the observed number of species, are both random variables.

For a correct model and given covariates for a ModelSite, the difference between the observed number of species and expected number of species is a random variable
with mean 0, and fixed variance.
For a ModelSite drawn from the common distribution, the mean is still 0, and the variance is a random variable.
The variance of species numbers for a ModelSite drawn at random can be estimated from
the fixed variance computed for many iid ModelSite covariate draws by averaging:
\deqn{ V[D] = E[D^2] - E[D]^2 = E[E[D^2|X]] - E[E[D|X]]^2 = E[E[D^2|X]] = E[E[(N - E[N|X])^2|X]] = E[E[N^2|X] - E[N|X]^2] = E[V[N|X]] }
The variance of species numbers for a ModelSite drawn at random can also be estimated from many observed ModelSites by averaging:
\deqn{ V[D] = V[N - E[N|X]]}
The mean difference can also be estimated from observations (and should be zero):
\deqn{ 0 = E[D] = E[E[D|X]] ~ \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i = 1}^m d_i }

\emph{No bias correction for use of insample data is included.}
